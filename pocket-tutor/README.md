## What it does

PocketTutor uses generative AI to construct a course syllabus for a topic you'd like to learn more about.  It will then generate lessons for each syllabus topic and read them aloud to you using your browser's built-in speech synthesis tools.  It's a convenient way to continue learning about hyper-specific subjects while you are doing tasks like commuting, doing chores, or cardio.

## Features

- Generates lessons based on your interests and reads them aloud
- Stores syllabus localStorage, so you can pick up where you left off

## Context

I created this project as part of a personal challenge to build one hackathon-styled project a week.  This is by no means complete (or even optimized).  It's simply a functional MVP.

## Future Improvements

- Better formatting on response text
- Retain client context between api calls.
- Options tab allowing for changes in tone, attitude, difficulty level, lenth of lecture, etc.
- Open Q&A session at end of lecture, supporting microphone access.
- Allow for more fine tuning of syllabus via chat.
- testing and linting
